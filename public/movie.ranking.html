<h1> The Best Movie According to Ankit </h1>
<h2> My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3> 3 IDIOTS </h3>
<p> 3 Idiots’ charts the japes and scrapes of three students at India’s top engineering university
    (the film was shot in Bangalore). Along the way, this coming-of-age full comedy movie in Hindi
    addresses ‘ragging’ (initiation rituals), the intense pressure to excel in education, student
    suicide, and the tension between the ambitions of students and their parents. ‘3 Idiots’ was
    a huge hit and confirmed Aamir Khan as the master of balancing good old-fashioned family
    entertainment with meaningful messages. </p>
<h3> Swades</h3>
<p> Pleasing audiences with a film so soon after the Oscar-nominated ‘Lagaan’ was always
    going to be tough for director Ashutosh Gowariker. And while ‘Swades’ underwhelmed
    those who compared it to ‘Lagaan’, it was still a solid film, and even better in some ways.
    Mohan Bhargav (Khan, in one of his best performances) is on a short break from his job at
        Nasa in the States and visits his hometown in India. The film focuses on Bhargav’s
        struggles with his country of birth, its inhabitants, and his own identity.

<h3> Bhaag Milkha Bhaag</h3>
<p> Milkha Singh – known as The Flying Sikh – was a world-champion Olympic runner in the 1950s
    and 1960s, who infamously lost the most important race of his life. ‘Bhaag Milkha Bhaag’
    shows us how he came to be one of India’s greatest runners, and how he overcame the demons
    of witnessing the massacre of his family during India’s partition. The success of the 
    film comes from its strong attention to detail, a superb performance from Farhan Akhtar
        as Singh, and an inspiring story.
